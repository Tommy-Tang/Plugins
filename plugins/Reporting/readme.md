# About this plug-in 
Pretty much like like the index page of the website, this plug-in
 allows users to filter through the CVE-Search data, but instead of
 displaying it in a webpage, it exports the data to a CSV file. It is
 also compatible with the filters from other plug-ins.
 
#Installation and setup
The installation of this plug-in is like the installation of any
 plug-in.
