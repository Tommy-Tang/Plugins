# About this plug-in
This plug-in allows users to parse NMAP scans to a list of
 vulnerabilities for the scanned systems and services. It is based
 off the [CVE-Scan](https://github.com/NorthernSec/CVE-Scan) Project
 by [NorthernSec](http://northernsec.eu). You can check out the
 [online API](http://northernsec.eu/cve-scan) before installing it,
 though the plug-in will be faster, due to direct database access.

# Installation and setup
The installation of this plug-in is like the installation of any
 plug-in, however, extra packages are required. You can install them
 with `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. Weasyprint has a set
 of sub-requirements. Please find the details
 [here](http://weasyprint.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html)
